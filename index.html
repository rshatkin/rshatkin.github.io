<p>Hi all! My name is Rachel Shatkin and I am very please to meet you! I am a print graphic designer by trade and am really looking forward to building my arsenol of skills and conquer the digital world of design! I am originally from Buffalo. GO BILLS! (that's right you heard me.) I went to undergrad in Boston, and have been living in NYC for about 9 months now. Crazy town this place is... Anyway, can't wait to work with you guys and I'm certain this will be a very interesting semester to say the least.</p>

<p><h2>XO Rachel</h2></p>
